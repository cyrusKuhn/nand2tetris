# Nand2Tetris Student Starter Repository

Welcome! This repository contains the starter files for the [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) coursework. 

Nand2Tetris software requires you to have Java installed. It's likely you already have Java installed, but check out their own instructions for [installing the software](https://www.nand2tetris.org/software).

I like the **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)** *integrated development environment (IDE)* for working in the course, and also for AI integration. Check out [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/download) (with personal gmail) or its [vscode integration](https://antigravity.google/docs/ide/extensions/vscode).

The instructions below are principally about allowing you to work with git version control. 

---

## First Up: Download the software package

See the [instructions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IkIR8Pwq3PY49QgXpUJOkUUVht-TKIET/view) to download the zip package. When you unzip the contents you'll see a folder structure like:

```
__MACOSX
nand2tetris:
    -projects
    -tools
```

The `tools` subfolder is where all the simulation software can be found. We will not change any of these contents.

The `projects` subfolder contains all the provided assignment and test files for completing the course. Below you will reproduce this folder in your own github space as a private git repository. This will allow for easy control and assessment as we progress through the course.


## Quick Start: Creating Your Private GitHub Workspace

Do **not** edit code directly inside a clone of this public repository. Instead, follow these steps to push your starter files to your own **private** repository.

### 1. Create your remote repository on GitHub
1. Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new).
2. Name the repository `nand2tetris-projects`.
3. Select **Private**.
4. **Do NOT check** "Add a README file", ".gitignore", or "License" (leave it completely blank).
5. Click **Create repository**.

### 2. Run These Commands in Your Terminal

Open your terminal, copy and run the block below (remember to replace `YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username):

```bash
# Clone this starter repository locally
git clone git@github.com:profstough/nand2tetris_26F.git nand2tetris-projects
cd nand2tetris-projects

# Re-link the repository to YOUR new private GitHub repo
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin git@github.com:YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/nand2tetris-projects.git

# Push the starter files to your private repo
git branch -M main
git push --set-upstream origin main
```

Of note, the above assumes you have [set up an ssh key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) for github access:
* **SSH:** `git@github.com:profstough/nand2tetris_26F.git`
* **HTTPS:** `https://github.com/profstough/nand2tetris_26F.git`



## MAC/Linux Setup Guide

### 1. Add Hardware Simulator Tools to Your PATH
To run `HardwareSimulator.sh` from your terminal without typing the full path every time:

**For Bash users** (add to `~/.bashrc`):
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/nand2tetris/tools"
```

**For Zsh users** (add to `~/.zshrc`):
```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path/to/nand2tetris/tools"
```

Replace `/path/to/nand2tetris/tools` with the actual path to your extracted `tools` folder (e.g., `$HOME/nand2tetris/tools`).

After editing your shell configuration file, reload it:
```bash
# For Bash
source ~/.bashrc

# For Zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now you can run the simulator directly:
```bash
HardwareSimulator.sh DMux4Way.tst
```


## Windows Setup Guide

Windows users are encouraged to use **Git Bash** so that all terminal commands match the macOS/Linux instructions.

### 1. Install Git Bash & VS Code
1. Download and install **[Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/)** (this installs Git Bash).
2. Download and install **[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)**.

### 2. Set Git Bash as Your Default Terminal in VS Code
1. Open VS Code.
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and type: **Terminal: Select Default Profile**.
3. Select **Git Bash** from the list.
4. Open a new terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl + ~`). You are now running a Linux-style Bash terminal on Windows!

### 3. Add Hardware Simulator Tools to Your Windows PATH
To run `HardwareSimulator.sh` from Git Bash without typing the full path every time:

1. Press `Win + R`, type `sysdm.cpl`, and press **Enter** (opens System Properties).
2. Go to the **Advanced** tab $\rightarrow$ click **Environment Variables**.
3. Under **User variables**, select `Path` and click **Edit**.
4. Click **New** and add the path to your extracted `tools` folder (e.g., `C:\nand2tetris-tools\tools`).
5. Click **OK** on all windows, then restart VS Code.

> **Note for Windows:** In Git Bash, you can run `.sh` scripts directly:
> ```bash
> HardwareSimulator.sh DMux4Way.tst
> ```
> *(If `HardwareSimulator.sh` isn't recognized, you can also run `HardwareSimulator.bat DMux4Way.tst` natively).*
